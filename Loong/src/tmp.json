        "eval_response": "Evaluation evidence: The assistant's answer does not match the gold answer in terms of accuracy and completeness. The references listed in the assistant's answer are entirely different from those in the gold answer, indicating a significant hallucination issue. Additionally, the assistant's answer does not include any citations, whereas the gold answer lists two specific citations. This discrepancy shows a lack of completeness and accuracy in the assistant's response.\n\nRating: [[10]]",
