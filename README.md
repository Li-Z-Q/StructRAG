StructRAG: Boosting Knowledge Intensive Reasoning of LLMs via Inference-time Hybrid Information Structurization
                      
            
                
We initially planned to organize and release the code after the paper was accepted, but we did not anticipate the widespread attention this work has recently received.     
       
We feel honored, and in order to help readers gain a deeper understanding of the concepts in the paper, we plan to release an unrefined version of the experimental code by October 29, 2024, which will accurately reflect the core process of the method described in the paper.       
        
The final, organized version of the code will be released after the paper is officially accepted.
