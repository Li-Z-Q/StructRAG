StructRAG: Boosting Knowledge Intensive Reasoning of LLMs via Inference-time Hybrid Information Structurization
                      
            
       
In order to help readers gain a deeper understanding of the concepts in the paper, we release an unrefined version of the experimental code, which can generally reflect the core process of the method described in the paper.       

Some details such as the prompts used in the framework and the training part for the router have not been organized yet. We plan to update them by November 4th.
        
The final, organized version of the code will be released after the paper is officially accepted.
